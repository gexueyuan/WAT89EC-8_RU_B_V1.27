* Overview: this function checks buttons state and creates GOL messages.
*           S3 and S4 are used for ARROW UP PRESSED and ARROW DOWN PRESSED
*           messages. S6 moves focus to the next control.
*           S5 creates CARRIGE RETURN PRESSED/RELEASED messages.
*                                                                       
* Input: pointer to the GOL message structure                                                          
*
